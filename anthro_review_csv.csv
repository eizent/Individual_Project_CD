Culture as Behavior: Structure and Emergence,Conrad M. Arensberg,1972,"The annual review of the fluid and protean science of anthropology which is to occupy this book reveals a discipline with visible progress in many empirical discoveries. Its continued devotion to fact-gathering and its careful observation of the human realities of cultural variation attest to its enduring tradition. Anthropology is still the proper heir of natural science and natural history. Its data are those that come, in one way or another, from recording past and current events in human and hominid lives, whether in the testimony of fossil and artifact or in the protocols of the fieldworker's notes and tapes. Its coverage is still immense, indeed encyclopedic. It ranges from the diaries of the ethologist animal watchers to computer-sorting of world- wide processes of evolutionary advance, from word uses and color categories of tribesmen to the emergence of empires or the current fading away in the world of the rural-urban distinction. It remains the one science bridging the gap between the ""hard"" and the ""soft"" sciences, uniting the Two Cultures of Sir Charles Snow. Yet the progress of anthropology displays a proliferation and sprawl that threatens its advance. There are, of course, master concepts which offer some unity. But often these are merely imported from outside, like evolution and ecology. Some parts, chapters here, show order in classification and clarity in identifying tested processes. There are established mutual dependencies among data already firm. Archaeological sequences and language families can be cited. In other parts, particularly in cultural and social anthropology, unity seems much less. The replication and the cumulation that in science depends upon agreed definitions and shared paradigms of method and infer- ence is too little. itself perhaps less to summation, a task already in the hands of the capable chapter writers, than to uncertainties. Obviously it is culture which provides the theme which unifies, if tenuously, the great sprawl of the science. Culture, as man's special behavior, remains the theme still implicit in the background of all the subdisciplines. Perhaps it would be most useful to treat the nature, emergence, variability, and relationships of culture.

Conceptual Progress in Physical Anthropology: Fossil Man,Bernard G. Campbell,1972,"The aim of science is to seek the simplest explanation of complex facts. We are apt to fall into the error of thinking that the facts are simple be- cause simplicity is the goal of our quest. The guiding motto in the life of every natural philosopher should be, seek simplicity and distrust it. The strictures which encompass and define scientific method are high Alfred North Whitehead (127, p. 163) lighted in an observational science such as paleontology, which permits prac- tically no experimentation. Progress in the study of human evolution based on the fossil record has been beset by nearly as many problems as it has solved. While today we know far more of the fossil evidence than those who wrote early in this century, we have also come to realize more clearly the theoretical difficulties which stand in our way. We know that we can never do more than present hypotheses on the basis of presently available evidence. As time-bound creatures, no ultimate truth about the origin and evolution of mankind can ever be known to us. The recent discovery of so many fossil hominids has, as we shall see, opened up a wider range of hypothetical possibilities than have been appro- priate in the past. Those fossils known earlier in this century, and indeed as late as 1955, could be fitted into a relatively simple and not very controver- sial phylogenetic lineage. The numerous fossils now known offer alternative interpretations (Figure 1). Since the number of possible hypotheses are both theoretically and practically unlimited, it is essential in our assessment of the present position to evoke the principle of William of Ockham that plurality should not be posited without need (essentia non sunt multiplicanda prater necessitatem), but as Whitehead has pointed out, this does not mean that the truth itself is necessarily simple (127). In this review we shall discuss first some of the most important fossil dis- coveries since 1955,1 and then consider their conceptual significance. ' Archaeological sites lacking fossil hominid remains are obviously relevant to an understanding of human evolution. In the present state of our understanding of cultural variation and the taxonomy of tool assemblages, however, it is most unwise to equate a particular culture with a particular hominid taxon. Because of limited",vol1.2
Studies of Modern Man,D. F. Roberts and J. C. Bear,1972,"This review of studies in the physical anthropology of modern man concerns papers that have appeared in the period from mid-1969 to mid-1971. Though far from comprehensive it aims to show how much activity there is in each major topic of investigation in the biological study of populations of man that exist today, and to pick out any trends in investigation that may be detectable. Several topics have been intentionally excluded, e.g. behavior studies, psychometric investigations, descriptive osteometry, and epidemiological works relating to particular disease states.",vol1.3
Dating Methods,Joseph W. Michels,1972,"Archaeological dating has undergone rapid development as part of a more general trend towards increasingly sophisticated scientific methodology, a trend that is being felt throughout the discipline of archaeology. We have not only seen refinement of traditional dating procedures but also the intro- duction of new techniques that considerably expand our ability to date past events. As in the case of other rapidly developing areas of archaeology, a substantial literature has accumulated that poses a challenge to archaeologists who merely want to keep up to date. I was asked to write this review when the editors learned I had just completed a book on dating methods (3). One observation that I can make as a result of my experience is that many of the important developments in archaeological dating represent contributions by the biological, physical, chemical, and mathematical sciences. A good portion of the relevant literature is written by specialists outside archaeology who often presume backgrounds in their respective fields that archaeologists sel- dom possess. As a result, the literature is not readily assimilated by the gen- eral archaeological profession. This problem has prompted recent efforts at syntheses that are intended for archaeological consumption such as the col- lection of essays edited by Michael & Ralph (29), those edited by Brothwell & Higgs (5) and the above-mentioned text (31). In this paper I will try to highlight some of the developments which are discussed in detail in these general works and attempt to show the magnitude of progress that has been made in the area of archaeological dating. The fact that recent technological breakthroughs are leading to a routini- zation of chronological analysis has considerable significance for the develop- ment of a more rigorous anthropological orientation in archaeology. Taking one example, we might note that there is growing momentum towards the application of general systems theory to archaeological analysis. One of the highlights of a systems approach is that it facilitates a dynamic analysis of cultural process (8). In such a framework the reconstruction of an archaeo- logical ""phase"" is viewed as the characterization of a complex cultural system at a given state along a multistate trajectory (4). The study of multiple phases is intended to document changes through time in the various compo-",vol1.4
Archaeological Settlement Patterns,Jeffrey R. Parsons,1972,"This paper reviews published material concerned with the analysis of pat- tern in the physical remains of human settlement. Although my major con- cern is with prehistoric settlement, I have also tried to deal with studies which focus on physical traces of occupation, whatever their status with respect to historical documentation. I have made no attempt to discuss the literature on settlement of industrialized societies at the nation-state level, nor have I tried to incorporate the abundant literature from locational geography, plant ecol- ogy, or animal ecology where techniques and methods have been developed which have a definite, although largely untapped, potential for new analytical approaches to archaeological settlement. Because I have focused on studies whose explicit purpose has been the description and analysis of settlement patterns, I have made no effort to discuss the vast literature ethnographical, archaeological, and historical which contains data of potential utility to set- tiement pattern studies. In this review I trace the historical development of the settlement pattern concept in archaeology; define the principal concerns and issues which inves- tigators have considered to be important; discuss something of the substantive results of settlement pattern study through a sampling of representative pub- lished materials; and provide an assessment of the major accomplishments and future needs of settlement pattern analysis in archaeology. DEVELOPMENT OF CONCEPT AND METHODOLOGY From the English-language literature it is apparent that the study of an- cient settlement has developed through two largely independent traditions: one in America and the other in England. The American tradition finds its most immediate roots in Morgan's last published work (67), which originally appeared in 1881. Here Morgan posed the critical question of how the re- mains of aboriginal residential architecture in North America reflected the social organization of the prehistoric peoples who occupied them.

Demographic Studies in Anthropology,Paul T. Baker and William T. Sanders,1972,"A common definition of the field of biological anthropology is that it con- cerns the description, causes, and consequencs of variability in human bio- logical characteristics. As such it is somewhat surprising that so little atten- tion has been devoted to such an important biological parameter as human demography. In the early development of anthropology there was a brief interest in demo graphy as attempts were made to discover whether some men had found a way to increase longevity. These myths persist with reports of great age in the USSR and the South American Andean region. Anthropologists were also curious about the longevity of our ancestors so that both historical and skele- tal studies of mortality were in vogue. At the opposite end of the life cycle considerable effort was expended on the study of sex ratios at birth and the nature of seasonality in birth. Despite these early interests the fie Id of demo g- raphy was not pursued with any depth until recently. At the moment interest in demographic data is very much on the rise and shows no sign of being near its peak. The reasons for the increased inter- est can be catalogued into three discrete developments of the 1960s. First, the development of extensive research programs on the nonhuman primate in his natural environment has produced a new body of descriptive data. Second, the development of human population genetics from the general synthetic theory of evolution has indicated the need for new types of demo graphic data on nonwestern populations. Finally, the strong interest in a subject area best called human ecology has suggested new ways in which we can understand the immediate causes and effects of population differences in demographic characteristics. In this paper we will attempt to highlight the current status of research in these topics even though much of the subject matter has been",vol1.6
"Environment, Subsistence, and Society: The Changing Archaeological Perspective",Ezra B. W. Zubrow,1972,"It is a cliche to begin a review article by acknowledging that the subject is too large to be examined in any comprehensive manner. Environment, subsis- tence, and society are each the domain of at least one discipline. Environ- ment is considered to be the proper subject for ecologists, biologists, geolo- gists, and geographers; subsistence is the domain of economists, nutritionists, and various agricultural specialists; society is studied by anthropologists, soci- ologists, and psychologists, to name only a few. Yet some men have at- tempted to relate the three subjects into an analytical framework. Few men have been as concise and yet been able to maintain as consistent a world view on this subject as John Aubrey (1626-97), the first person to consider Stone- henge and Avebury in archaeological perspective. He stated: Let us imagine then what kind of countrie this was in the time of the Ancient Britons. By the nature of the soil, which is a sour woodsere land, very natural for the production of oakes especially, one may conclude that this North Division was a shady dismal wood; and the inhabitants almost as savage as the Beasts whose skins were their only rayment (Daniel9 ). One of the few advantages of trying to research the current status of such a broad subject is that one often gets an impression of the directions in which the scientific domain is headed. Thomas Kuhn (21) has suggested that there is an evolutionary progression in the development of sciences. Essentially he suggests that a developing science passes through the following stages: 1. First, there is a pre-paradigm stage in which there are many subjects and schools of thought competing for prominence. Since there is no com- mon body of belief, each researcher is forced to build his field from its foundations. 2. Second, out of this disparate body of contention, there emerges either a single theory or a set of new theories which not only reorganizes the ",vol1.7
"Environment, Subsistence, and Society",Karl G. Heider,1972,"The relationship between environment, subsistence, and society has been one of the constant and chief concerns of anthropology. Here we shall exam ine recent developments which relate to this area. An annual review might be expected to cover only books and articles with a publication date of the pre- vious year. But since this is the first annual review, I am arbitrarily widening the scope of this survey to include the last few years, roughly, the 1968-1971 period. This dateline artificially excludes the major influential works of such anthropologists as Julian Steward, Harold Conklin, Charles Frake, and Clif- ford Geertz. However, there are so many excellent recent summaries of the development of this field that there is no point in adding another. The inter- ested reader can turn to Vada & Rappaport (56), Netting (41), Damas (11), Anderson (1), and Harris (26). Here we shall try to focus on the cutting edge of the field. What is the state of the theory? What new methods and techniques are emerging? And what recent substantive knowledge has been brought forth? To anticipate the conclusions, we will find that the theory has been ham- pered by a simplistic polemic; that important refinements in methodology are now emerging, perhaps more from cultural geography than from anthropol- ogy; and that the actual substantive results, both in terms of satisfactory de- scriptions of individual societies and of determination of regular principles of relationships, are still too often trivial or overgeneralized. The subject can be phrased as the interrelationship of environment, sub- sistence, and society, or it may be more succinctly coded as ecology or cul- tural ecology. This can be misleading, for ""ecology"" now means so many things to so many scientists, parascientists, and antiscientists that any use of it will be challenged. I think that it is enough to say here that most anthropolo- gists and geographers who use the term ""cultural ecology"" are concerned with the interrelationships of environment, subsistence, and society. It is also well to note here that although we are most interested in studies which emphasize the relationships between environment, subsistence, and so- ciety, we must pay close attention to some studies which although they focus primarily on subsistence activities, utilize methodological innovations which promise to aid the more integrated studies.",vol1.8
"Ethnohistory: A Review of its Development, Definitions, Methods, and Aims",Robert M. Carmack,1972,"The relationship between history and anthropology has too often been viewed in terms of the misleading dichotomy between the ideographic, the specific and unique, and the nomothetic, the abstract, and general (see, for example, Boas 13; Harris 40; Kroeber 46; White 102). Nagel (67), who traces the dichotomy back to Aristotle, has convincingly demonstrated the use of generalizations and specific cases in both history and science, and Sah- lins and Service have done a similar thing through their analysis of specific and general evolution (75). they were in the diachronic and documentarian senses. The founding fathers of anthropology Morgan, Tylor, Maine, Marx, and others--sought to find the origins and antecedents of sociocultural systems and to trace their evolu- tion through time. They based their studies on documentary accounts about native cultures written by travelers, missionaries, etc. As Kroeber repeatedly claimed, the historical approach was precociously applied in the social sci- ences, compared to the biological and physical sciences (47). The delayed development of a historical approach in the other sciences, Kroeber argued (48), was the requirement of a prior development of systematic, synchronic generalizations. followed the evolutionary beginnings of anthropology -viz. the need for de- tailed, synchronic studies. The aversion of Radcliffe- Brown and Malinowski to historical studies is well known. The structure-functionalism of British so- cial anthropology was ahistorical on all counts. In the study of the struc- tures of whole societies it was nomothetic, in the almost total reliance on ethnographic observations it was antidocumentarian, and in failing to study social change it was synchronic. In spite of Harris' recent attempt to portray the American culture histori- ans' work as exclusively ideographic (41), there is good reason to view it as ahistorical in certain fundamental ways. Certainly the culture historians can- not be accused of failing to make diachronic studies, as under Boas' guidance The early evolutionists were not historical in the ideographic sense but This suggests one explanation for the patently ahistorical phase which",vol1.9
Social Strategies and Social Relationships,"Norman E. Whitten, Jr. and Dorothea S. Whitten",1972,"A shifting emphasis from concern with social or cultural rules to an interest in adaptive strategies of human aggregates has become increasingly evi- dent in anthropology during the past 20 years. The general theoretical basis for such work seems to lie in multilinear evolutionary theory, especially as set forth by Steward (135, 136), and discussed as ""specific evolution"" by Sahlins & Service (123). The fundamental problem to which such theory pertains is simply how to conceive of continuity and change within a unified frame of reference. In social anthropology there are several milestones, such as the conceptual frameworks of Firth (47) and Lévi-Strauss (92) and the ethnog- raphies of Leach (86) and Barth (11). Alland (2) has made a major effort to consider evolutionary processes and ongoing adaptation of human aggre- gates within a unified scheme, which unfortunately omits most of the produc- tive social anthropological studies. Among other things, this review seeks to redress such omission. The analysis of social strategies is emerging as the core of adaptational ' The actual review was undertaken under the auspices of National Science Foundation Grant No. GS-2999 as part of the conceptual refinement necessary to understand differential ethnicity as adaptive strategies in the face of national develop- ment policies in ""third world"" nations.

Where possible we have referred the reader to existing reviews of relevant literature of many crucial approaches touched on here, such as ""adapta- tional theory,"" ""game theory,"" ""conflict theory,"" ""exchange theory,"" ""social change.""

Ethnoscience 1972,Oswald Werner,1972,"After the first flurry of successes at discovering folk classifications by relatively rigorous eliciting techniques, few major advances have been made in the direction of a better understanding of lexical/semantic fields.? Casagrande & Hale (6) provided a nearly exhaustive list of the major semantic rela- tions, but little work followed in spite of increasing evidence that lexical/se- mantic relations are more readily recognizable as language universals than are semantic components (Werner 69). A partial explanation is that work in this area is extremely difficult and sociolinguistic approaches (ethnography of communication) seem to offer easier solutions. I think this is an unrealistic estimation since considerations of context, though certainly crucial, are also certainly more complex than so-called ""context free"" semantics. Advances have been few because experimentation with large lexical fields exceeds the limitations of procedures by hand. It is simply too difficult to keep track of 1000 or more lexical items and their ramifications. The system- atization of lexicography -and ethnoscience can be viewed as an attempt at systematic and nonlinear (nonalphabetic) lexicography has always been burdened by the bulk of data it had to process. The rather unsystematic vari- ations of definitions in existing dictionaries are a living monument to this problem. Progress in ethnoscience is slow because the purpose of the exercise was never made entirely clear. Theorizing in terms of ""synthetic informants"" or in terms of question-answering systems promises to fulfill for the first time Goodenough's dictum that an ethnography should allow one to behave like a native of that culture--at least for the general area of cultural verbal be- havior based on cultural knowledge. It cannot be stressed sufficiently that This research was in part supported by a grant from NIMH MH 10940.

Kinship Semantics,Harold W. Scheffler,1972,"""Accounts of meaning usually throw a handful of putty at the target of sign phenomena. in anthropological theory since the publication of Morgan's Systems of Consanguinity and Affinity of the Human Family in 1871 (42). Yet, in the view of a number of anthropologists, many of us have still to learn the lesson taught by Morgan's early critics: that many or all of the terminological sys- tems Morgan dealt with are not systems of kin classification, that their terms do not designate categories of kin, or if they ever do, this is only one of their semantic functions, and perhaps a relatively trivial one at that. Elsewhere (59) Lounsbury and I have attempted to demonstrate that this assessment of the ethnographic facts is mistaken, that the designations kin- ship, kinship terms, and systems of kin classification have not been misapplied by most ethnographers in the way that their critics (47, 66) would have us believe; and we have given some indication of the concepts and methods we think are appropriate to the description, analysis, and comparison of such systems. This essay recapitulates the major points of our earlier argument and reviews some of the more recent, as well as very old, literature on the subject of kinship semantics. The focus here is on what I think are the theoretically most fundamental issues in the study of kinship semantics, i.e. of the meanings of kinship terms. Little is said about the study of systems of social action whose norms are grounded in relations of genealogical connection. [A masterful review and cri- tique of three principal ""styles in the study of kinship"" in this, the broader sense of the term, is now available (2).] This considerably reduces the num- ber of publications that need to be noted, but I have reduced the number even more by concentrating on the works of a few scholars (not the only ones, of course) who have dealt with a wide range of topics and whose writ- ings have significantly influenced the work of other anthropologists.

Structuralism in Cultural Anthropology,Pierre Maranda,1972,"This chapter consists of five parts. The first proposes a definition of structuralism against the background of other anthropological approaches. A brief diachronic sketch is found in Part I. Part III reviews some very recent con- tributions. A theoretical summary follows in Part IV. Finally, Part V focuses first on transformational analysis before examining a few testable hypotheses and their verification. The position of structuralism among other approaches in anthropology can be located by means of the Aristotelian notions of causality. Aristotle, and many after him, look at epistemology in terms of etiology. To know means to be able to map the different causes of a phenomenon. There are four causes according to traditional European philosophy: the material cause, the efficient cause, the formal cause, and the final cause. The material cause answers the question ""What is the phenomenon made of?"" The efficient cause answers the question ""What/who made it, what is its origin?"" The for- mal cause answers the question ""What is it?"" And the final cause answers the question ""What is the phenomenon for?"" Applied to social anthropology, the grid yields the following, where neat- ness does not necessarily mean oversimplification. Material cause: biological and physical anthropology and ethology in so far as they bear on social an- thropology-generally speaking, cultural ecology. Efficient cause: evolution- ary theory. Formal cause: structural theory. Final cause: functional theory. This is not the place to deal with the epistemological implications of the model or with the relationships between the different causes. All are different mappings of the same phenomenon, and therefore all approaches reveal dif- ferent configurations. One can look at a piece of chalk or at the element of kinship from different viewpoints and map them accordingly. Thus, the defi- mition of a chalk crayon in terms of limestone (material cause), or of its manufacturer (efficient cause), or of its cylindrical shape (formal cause), or 'It is appropriate to use this as a frame of reference as anthropology belongs to the European world view.",vol1.13
"Linguistic Theory: Syntax, Semantics, Pragmatics",Michael Silverstein,1972,"In one sense ""linguistic theory"" is whatever linguistic theorists choose to do. In the late 1940s, for example, they sought to characterize the relation- ship between some corpus, whether fixed or potential, and an analytic state- ment of structure. With the self-proclaimed revolution in the field during the past 15 or so years, linguistic theory in the dominant school has been defined as the construction of a universal theory of grammar in the sense of neces- sary universals of linguistic ""competence."" This is from the point of view of what linguistic theorists are doing. Clearly all linguists at all times have as a general aim the elucidation of language in every respect; this is the ideal lin- guistic theory. To a great extent, the issues of theory in syntax and semantics are the same as those in phonology and morphology. These include criteria of cate- gory and rule types, rule applicability, naturalness of linguistic generaliza- tions, diachrony versus synchrony. Inasmuch as the most intense recent con- troversy has detailed areas of ""syntax,"" broadly conceived, and ""meaning,"" and because of severe space limitations on the current report, I limit my ex- position to these concerns. In addition, this discussion of the more restricted area is based principally on the last two bibliographical years, with emphasis intended to be in proportion to the work reported. During this period linguis- tic theory as defined by the transformational generative point of view contin- ed to dominate the field as the most formalized, most developed, and most explicit framework. While it is true that the transformational generative school is by far the dominant one in linguistics, continuing work is reported on several other ap- proaches. It is interesting that once such a theory as generative grammar be- comes dominant, then all discussions of other theories become polarized to arguing with this dominant one. This is clearest in stratificational theory, as developed by Sydney Lamb and others. There was a typically vicious attack on stratificational phonology, for example, in Paul Postal's Aspects of Phono- logical Theory (133), and this has led to a standard disclaimer for the ap-",vol1.14
Linguistic Models in Anthropology,Mridula Adenwala Durbin,1972,"The basis of analogy between disciplines leads to epistemological and other philosophical discussions. Likewise, the basis of analogy between anthropology and linguistics directs discussion into the similarity of their subject matter, goals, and problems of analysis. Anthropological literature abounds with assertions of an overwhelming congruency (substantive, functional, historical, ontogenetic) between language and culture, but because most statements are inexplicitly formulated, it is difficult to assess the common problems and properties of these two fields. When discussing a problem of this nature, one could attempt to deal with several topics: (a) the basis of analogy between two disciplines in general and between linguistics and anthropology in particular; (b) the similarity between the goals and the subject matter of both anthropology and linguistics; (c) the nature of the linguistic model and its core concepts; (d) the comparison of various con- cepts used in both fields in order to expose differences that have developed by the very process of analogy; (e) the extent to which various concepts of linguistics are applied to cultural data, and the discussion of why certain concepts are not applied; (f) the various degrees of success in the use of these models; and finally (g) the overall impact of the use of the linguistic model in anthropology. Because any attempt to incorporate discussions of all these topics would require a much larger work than this, I am forced to exclude discussion of the factors that have led to an analogy in the two fields. Instead, I aim to assess how effectively the linguistic model has been applied to anthropology. It ought to be pointed out first that because several formal models are available in linguistics one of the prominent dangers in analogy is the confusion of concepts originally restricted to different models. Anthropology has not been spared such mistaken uses of some linguistic concepts, e.g. contrast vs complementation, component vs distinctive feature. Furthermore, in the course of the discussion, it will also be pointed out that the application of the linguistic model to anthropology has only been partly successful (when compared to linguistics) because several aspects of the model were not utilized.",vol1.15
American Indian Linguistics,Karl V. Teeter,1972,"Anthropologists tend to look to American Indian linguistics for a classificatory philosopher's stone, one which will provide large-scale schemes to cor- respond with those derived from study of cultural traits and natural areas. Alas, the facts are yet recalcitrant. There is thus a constant temptation to exceed actual knowledge, but here the neophyte has the advantage over the scholar. The true key to American Indian languages is a willingness to accept diversity. The well-known Indo-European language family had the geograph- ical extent its name suggests prior to New World colonization, but even the wildest scholarly speculation finds no less than four American Indian language families of Indo-European internal diversity within the confines of North America. that is not original with me, but rather is based directly on a little-known aspect of a famous article by Sapir (78), as clarified and somewhat simpli- fied by later work, particularly that of Haas. Within this framework I shall summarize the current state of description and comparative work for each family. Languages not securely classifiable in an internally differentiated family, either for lack of evidence or distance from obvious relatives- language isolates in the term of Haas -will be treated separately, and pos- sible wider relationships then briefly discussed. Space limitations have dictated a narrowly linguistic concern in this paper. Such related topics as ethnographic semantics are omitted, and the emphasis here is on the status and details of recent and current work in descriptive and historical linguistics. The same consideration plus the writer's own limitations additionally circumscribe the America of the title to America north of Mexico, although a more reasonable division in terms of relation- ship would include both Mexico and Central America. In writing this paper I have incurred two debts. The first is to direct correspondents. In 1971, Kinkade (49) published a roster of linguists and anthropologists currently working on American Indian languages, containing the names of over 300 scholars. I have circularized those on the list, inquir- ing as to their current and recent work, and received a generous response from more than half this number. I regret the necessity for severe selection in actual literature cited, but hereby acknowledge gratefully the education received from all those kind enough to reply.

Inspiring Continuities,Karen B. Strier and Don Brenneis,2023,"In her provocative Perspective article, Ruth Tringham reflects on the people and pro- cesses that shaped and shifted her rich and multifaceted research trajectory. These ""triggers of inspiration,"" as Tringham christens them, influenced her early path to the Neolithic of Eastern Europe with its initial focus on the clues that flaked stone assemblages could provide into changing prehistoric subsistence patterns. They also introduced her to the ethnographic and historical frameworks of anthropology, which brought both nuance and depth to a more traditional archaeological analysis of culture change. Her research continued to be inspired by people and events during the disruptive period from 1988 to 1993, when political changes were reconfiguring Eastern Europe. During this same period, feminist critiques of archaeology were also taking off, sparking new ways of looking at old questions and data. The infusion of gender considerations into archaeological analvses provided new dimensions in which Tringham could en- rich her signature small-scale approach of household analyses with the life histories of their individual occupants. This disruptive period also coincided with revolutionary ad- vances in digital technology, which Tringham embraced from the outset. She was quick to recognize the ""power of its multimodal and multimedia complex navigational struc- tures,"" which she harnessed for interpreting both the processes by which archaeologists reconstruct prehistory and alternative scenarios that can be created. Tringham's ""archaeology with the senses"" and juxtaposition of ""imagined narratives with empirical data"" are amplified by the reviews encompassed in the two themes, Mul- timodality and Security/Insecurity, that weave through this volume. Indeed, traces of Tringham's appreciation for the ""humanistic way of using scientific data"" can be found across the critical reviews representing all subfields of anthropology.",vol52.1
Acknowledging Inspirations in a Lifetime of Shifting and Pivoting Standpoints to Construct the Past,Ruth Tringham,2023,"In this Perspective article, I am able to draw the various strands of my intellectual thinking and practice in archaeology and European prehistory into a complex narrative of changing themes. In this narrative, I draw attention to the inspirational triggers of these transformations to be found in works and words of colleagues and events within and outside my immediate discipline. A group of events between 1988 and 1993 disrupted (in a good way) the trajectory of my professional life and provided a convenient anchor around which my themes pivoted and regrouped with very different standpoints. But some trends in my way of working remained constant and contributed, I hope, to a career of cumulative knowledge. Along the way, I show the significance, in terms of my personal intellectual context as well as archaeological practice in general, of my published works as well as more obscure and some unpublished works that are cited here for the first time.",vol52.2
Recent Developments in the Archaeology of Long-Distance Connections Across the Ancient Indian Ocean,Shinu Anna Abraham,2023,"Reviewing material connections across the ancient Indian Ocean in a brief review is a daunting task. The ancient Indian Ocean is spatially and temporally vast, embracing a dizzying array of communities with their own histories and motivations, occupying littoral tracts that border hinterlands with their own desirable resources and commodities, all traversing complex maritime environments. Building the evidentiary database requires the coordinated efforts of multiple specialties, including but not limited to history, archaeology, epigraphy, numismatics, maritime technology, and materials science. The resulting maelstrom of scholarship (particularly in the last two decades) can, for both experts and nonspecialists, obscure important developments concerning this geographic space, and may in part explain why there has been limited anthropological engagement with this material.

This review seeks instead to offer a broad synthesis, enabling the reader to appreciate the chronological and geographic scope of research and introducing multiple points of entry for those wishing to delve deeper. Its scope is thus deliberately delimited. First, as a review of the archaeology of the Indian Ocean (Supplemental Figure 1), I foreground fresh contributions about material connectivities, minimizing a historiography that stretches deep into the previous century and has been reviewed countless times. Second, I focus on sites (primarily ports, transshipment points, settlements, and mortuary sites) with archaeologically visible nonlocal materials. Not surprisingly, these are generally ceramic, stone, glass, and metal artifacts; the many perishable trade goods are represented mostly by shipping and storage containers. Third, while there exists abundant archaeological research on material links between communities within subregions of the Indian Ocean, here I emphasize material traces of the long-distance maritime-based movement of cultural elements (objects, people, ideas, etc.) between the subregions.",vol52.3
Rethinking Neandertals,April Nowell,2023,"During a graduate seminar on Neandertals, the late Paleolithic archaeologist Prof. Harold Dibble told students assembled around a table the story of his recent trip to the barber. It was right after the release of the 1986 film Clan of the Cave Bear, based on the novel of the same name by Jean Auel (1980). His barber had wanted to talk about how terrible the film was. In fact, everywhere Dibble went, people wanted to share their often emotional and deep-seated opinions on whether it was a good film or a bad one, based not on plot or the acting chops of its lead, Darryl Hannah, but rather on how realistically Neandertals had been portrayed. Either they were not “human enough” or the director had gotten this species “just right.” Dibble pointed out that he had not once had a similar conversation with anyone about the film Star Wars. Moviegoers accepted that light sabers made one long, sustained sound when in use instead of something more staccato, and that spaceships banked in space despite the lack of oxygen. Even the famed film critic Roger Ebert (1986) gave Clan of the Cave Bear 1.5 stars, writing that the movie “approaches those times with a modern sensibility. It shows us a woman winning respect from a patriarchal tribe, when, in reality, the [Neandertal] men would have just banged her over the head real good. It isn't grim enough about what things were probably like back then.” There is a lot to unpack in Ebert's assertion about male and female roles in the Pleistocene (see Nowell & Chang 2014), but his review and Dibble's experience getting his hair cut beg the question of why the general public and even scientists have what at times appears to be an emotional connection to our extinct cousins.

In this article, I first provide an overview of the Neandertals by briefly recounting their initial discovery and subsequent interpretation by scientists. I then discuss our current understanding of the temporal and geographic span of these hominins and their taxonomic affiliation. Next, I explore what progress we have made in our understanding of Neandertal lifeways and capabilities over the past decade [what Papagianni & Morse (2015, p. 14) refer to as a “Golden Age” in Neandertal research], particularly in light of new technologies and changing perspectives. In the process, I consider whether these advances in knowledge qualify as “Black Swans” (Frayer 2019). In economics1, a Black Swan is a term used to describe an extremely rare and unpredictable event that has severe consequences but in hindsight was foreseeable (Taleb 2010). Recently, Frayer (2019) has argued that some advances, such as the sequencing of the Neandertal genome and the discovery of a Neandertal “necklace” at the site of Krapina in Croatia (Frayer et al. 2020, Radovčić et al. 2015), are paleoanthropological Black Swans with widespread consequences for scientists’ perceptions of Neandertals. Building on this analysis, I look at ongoing debates in the field using Neandertal extinction as a case study. By way of discussion and conclusion, I return to the story with which I began this article to understand why Neandertals continue to engender interest, and indeed emotion, among scientists and the general public alike.",vol52.4
Reconceptualizing Archaeological Perspectives on Long-Term Political Change,Gary M. Feinman,2023,"A profound reshaping of social scientific knowledge is currently taking place. Compared to the natural and medical sciences, the social sciences have been remarkably conservative.

—Mike Savage (2021, p. 7)

The decades spanning the mid-nineteenth to the mid-twentieth centuries constituted an era of marked academic growth and institutionalization in many global regions. In the social sciences and history, this period was characterized by a focus on questions concerning the rise of early urban centers, variation in governance and leadership in large, hierarchically organized polities, and, more generally, the diversity of human political behaviors and relations—past and present (e.g., Almond 1996). These issues had already engaged philosophers and scholars for millennia (Almond 1996, Trigger 2006), but with the mid-nineteenth-century institutionalization of the academic social sciences, including archaeology, the foundations for contemporary conceptual perspectives and key underpinning tenets were rooted. The greater attention given to such issues was spurred by many factors that centered around increased global travel and intensified colonialism, which fostered growing awareness of the highly diverse ways in which humans were organized globally; expanded knowledge of the architectural and ruinous residuals of past (ancient) civilizations; and marked growth in the sizes of nation-states and colonialist empires of that era (e.g., Feinman & Neitzel 2020, Kohl 1998). Although much of the theorizing was aimed at explaining the triggers of organizational variation and diachronic change, the data on hand were mostly synchronic, drawn heavily from accounts of contemporary peoples, and that disjuncture has been and remains an impediment.

In archaeology and cognate disciplines, conceptual frames birthed in the nineteenth century were revised a century later, at which time they underpinned a burst of research (Binford 2002, Feinman & Price 2001). Key comparative approaches and archaeological research programs were initiated, and the findings from these have in turn defined the last 60–70 years of investigation and recent visions of long-term political change (e.g., Marcus 2008, Spencer 1997). Here, I briefly unpack this extended research history and note the wealth of empirical findings generated over the past several decades, much of it from archaeology. The integration and comparative synthesis of recent archaeological findings with other textual, ethnographic, and conceptual advances not only has expanded the material basis to assess long-term political change, but also raises issues with extant perspectives and tenets that have guided investigation.",vol52.5
Critical Geoarchaeology: From Depositional Processes to the Sociopolitics of Earthen Life,Andrew M. Bauer,2023,"Geoarchaeology—the practice of using techniques rooted in the geosciences to address archaeological research questions—has long-established foci on site-formation processes, geochronology, and the reconstruction of paleoenvironmental contexts as objects of scholarly investigation (e.g., Courty et al. 1989, Goldberg & Macphail 2006, Nicoll et al. 2021, Rapp & Hill 2006, Waters 1992). Such topics of inquiry have been so fundamental to the specialty that some scholars have suggested that all archaeology is essentially “geoarchaeology,” given the degree to which any archaeological interpretation is premised on assumptions or explicit inferences about the formation and preservation of the excavated archaeological record (cf. Maher 2017, Renfrew 1976). While geoarchaeological research justifiably and necessarily maintains emphases on understanding environmental factors that have contributed to shaping the formation, preservation, and contemporary distribution of the archaeological record at multiple spatial scales (e.g., Araujo et al. 2020, Bauer et al. 2004, Goff et al. 2021, Mallol & Mentzer 2017), in recent decades there has also been an increasing effort to establish stronger links between geoarchaeology and other interpretive and theoretical concerns of archaeology, anthropology, and the broader social sciences and humanities within which these disciplines are situated (e.g., Maher 2017). These efforts have generally taken several different forms of theoretical engagement that serve as the basis of this review. More specifically, here I focus on four overlapping research orientations that have explicitly extended the reach of geoarchaeological work beyond its more conventional topics: (a) interpretive, symbolic, and social approaches in geoarchaeological research; (b) articulations with recent developments in posthumanist and new materialist scholarship; (c) the application of geoarchaeological investigations to historical ecology and political ecology research programs; and (d) critical engagement with ongoing interdisciplinary scholarship on the Anthropocene.

Taken together, these different orientations offer new possibilities for geoarchaeological research to inform anthropological attention to social and environmental production and to contribute to broader conversations in the humanities and social sciences. However, these opportunities also come with challenges and pitfalls. The embrace of some strands of new materialist and posthumanist thought, for instance, has significant shortcomings in how this scholarship addresses concerns for power, inequalities, and political responsibility (e.g., Bauer & Bhan 2018, Harman 2009, Van Dyke 2015). Moreover, (geo)artifact classification schemes, typologies, and temporal systematics are not neutral analytical devices (e.g., Agbe-Davies 2016, Finney & Edwards 2016). Thus, to be clear, these new research orientations need not seamlessly articulate with each other. Yet collectively they enable geoarchaeological research to emphasize the social and cultural significance of earthen materials and substances in relationship to human–environment dynamics and histories at multiple temporal and spatial scales. Given the contemporary context of ongoing concerns for global environmental change (e.g., Crutzen 2002), such geoarchaeological research is thus well positioned to contribute to transdisciplinary conversations about social and environmental production, emphasizing, for instance, resilience and sustainability (e.g., Crumley et al. 2015, French et al. 2017) while also pushing beyond these interests to critically interrogate the ontologies and ideological bases in which conservation policies and discourses are rooted.",vol52.6
Slaving and Slave Trading in Africa,Rachel Ama Asaa Engmann,2023,"Slavery in Africa dates to antiquity, though no precise estimates of its scale exist. The terms “slave” and “slavery” are found in many African dialects, languages, and sayings. Yet, definitions of enslavement and slave status remain elusive precisely because it has existed in various forms across Africa, spatially and temporally. It is, therefore, useful to speak of slavery in Africa but not “African slavery,” as if slavery were coterminous with the continent (Cooper 1979). Large- and small-scale systems of servility and unfree labor in the Savanna and Sahel existed for centuries (Klein & Lovejoy 1979). Slave trading networks in Africa transported people across the Sahara and the Atlantic and Indian Oceans, with significant numbers of people sent to the Middle East, India, central Asia, and South and Southeast Asia. Africa, however, was not only a source of export of people; enslaved persons were also imported into the continent. Together, slaveries and slave trades have facilitated the movement of people, things, knowledge, skills, ideas, and imaginaries into, out of, and across Africa, transforming communities in the continent and beyond.

This review provides an overview of some of the themes and questions that have driven scholarly research into the dynamics and consequences of the capture, trade, and use of enslaved men, women, and children in Africa, with a focus on Ghana. I suggest that the history and legacies of slavery and slave trading cannot be understood without reference to African historiography, the politics of knowledge production, and present-day heritage tourism. In reviewing insights generated by historical and anthropological research, I also briefly introduce some of the possibilities, problems, and challenges of archaeological approaches to studying slavery and slave trading. These approaches offer fruitful future research directions and demonstrate that archaeology is in conversation with—and of value to—those outside the discipline.",vol52.7
"Water Needs, Water Insecurity, and Human Biology",Asher Y. Rosinger,2023,"Water is the most basic human need, yet it is among the most complex biocultural phenomena as it links the environment, culture, and biology (Rosinger 2020). Water needs, use, and security shape and are shaped by all facets of life—cultural, dietary, political, and environmental. There has been burgeoning research interest on water-related issues in anthropology and other fields due to water crises, climate change, and the declaration of water as a basic human right and its inclusion in the United Nations’ sustainable development goals. Two prior Annual Review of Anthropology articles used political, economic, and environmental anthropology approaches to discuss water (Ballestero 2019, Orlove & Caton 2010). Yet, globally, two billion people still lack access to safely managed drinking water (WHO & UNICEF 2021), which has tremendous health and human biology implications. An integrative approach linking physiological water needs to water insecurity (WI) is needed to attain a complete picture of how water affects human biology due to its inherent interdisciplinary nature.

There has been little integration of the water needs and WI literatures owing to differences in operationalization and scale (Wutich et al. 2020b). Water needs are approached as a physiological and nutritional question (Sawka et al. 2005) and examined on a more acute scale (hourly or daily). In contrast, WI is studied as an experiential or resource-based question (Jepson et al. 2017, Octavianti & Staddon 2021) and examined on a longer timescale (month or year). Yet how people meet both their immediate physiological water needs and the water needs for all of life's tasks, including cooking, hygiene, and livelihoods, is inherently connected and tied to human biological outcomes. Competing effects of hydration and stress along with ultimate and proximate causation related to coping strategies lead to complexities in deciphering how water needs versus WI affect human biology.

Biological Normalcy,Andrea S. Wiley,2023,"Examining and contesting ideas about what is “normal” is a core concern for anthropologists, who describe human population variability and try to understand it within its local context and from a comparative perspective. In doing so, anthropologists challenge judgments about diverse ways of being, which include assumptions or assertions about what is normal human behavior or biology, and thereby provide more inclusive views of what it means to be human. The term normal is used in widely varying discourses beyond anthropology and has meanings that encompass the descriptive (statistical) and the evaluative (normative). When applied to human biology, these dual meanings are particularly evident in biomedicine, where normal is equated with healthy. However, embedded in the term healthy are biases about what is normal that come out of particular cultural and historical contexts. Here I review the ways that normal is understood and used in anthropological and related studies of human biology and biological variation and propose a framework for understanding how the two meanings of normal inform each other and their consequences for human biology.

This review has three interrelated aims. One is to examine uses of the term normal in anthropology and related fields, with a focus on how it is applied to the study of human biology and biological variation. The second is to develop the analytic framework of biological normalcy to identify relationships between the statistical/descriptive and evaluative/normative meanings of the term normal. The third is to provide some illustrative examples.",vol52.9
"Human Bodies in Extreme Environments
",Cara Ocobock,2023,"Human habitation of extreme environments is a long-standing area of interest within biological anthropology and human biology, and with good reason because humans have successfully inhabited every continent on this planet. Humans in extreme environments offer the opportunity to document evidence of multiple levels of adaptation from genetic to functional. We have come a long way over more than a century and gained a better understanding of human biological flexibility, phenotypically and genetically, in the face of extreme environments in terms of both adaptation and acclimatization, though there is still a great deal more to learn.

Unfortunately, there is a pressing need now more than ever to improve our understanding of how human bodies survive and thrive in extreme environments. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change released its sobering sixth assessment report, which unequivocally states that human activity is driving global climate change (IPCC 2021). Human-induced climate change has resulted in increasingly variable and extreme weather events across the globe. Just within the United States in 2021, the state of Texas experienced an uncharacteristic ice storm, the Pacific Northwest grappled with extreme heat and extensive wildfires, and hurricanes flooded parts of the South and Northeast coasts. Globally, the 2022 men's World Cup in Qatar experienced unseasonably high temperatures and humidity, and in December 2022, the Horn of Africa was experiencing its worst drought in decades, devastating people through severe hunger, malnutrition, and dehydration.",vol52.10
"Environment, Epigenetics, and the Pace of Human Aging",Elisabeth A. Goldman and Kirstin N. Sterner,2023,"The demographics of the global population are changing in unprecedented ways. Over the next 3 decades, the number of adults aged 60 and older will increase twofold, to 2.1 billion, while the number of adults aged 80 and older will triple to 426 million (WHO 2021). Since the mid-twentieth century, average life expectancy has increased by more than 20 years, due in large part to medical and technological advancements, improved treatment of infectious disease, better sanitation, and food security in many parts of the world (K. Christensen et al. 2009, Vaupel et al. 2021), although discrepancies in the availability and accessibility of health care, technological, and nutritional resources still exist within and across national borders. However, the rise in average global life expectancy has not been accompanied by reductions in rates of chronic, noncommunicable disease, reflecting a lack of substantial progress in also extending average healthspan (i.e., the number of years a person maintains their desired quality of life free of major age-related disease or disability) (Crimmins 2015). As the older-adult population continues to expand, so does an already urgent need for a comprehensive social and public health infrastructure capable of supporting individuals as they age (Briller & Carrillo 2020, Crews 2022). Such infrastructure will require large investment, particularly in countries where health care systems are focused on addressing the burden of communicable diseases (i.e., infectious and parasitic diseases and maternal, perinatal, and nutritional conditions) and less focused on the types of chronic, noncommunicable diseases commonly associated with increased age. In addition, popular interest in “healthy aging”—maintaining feelings of physical and cognitive health, personal autonomy, and continued engagement with one's community throughout old age—has grown substantially in recent years (van Leeuwen et al. 2019). However, the question of how best to distinguish unhealthy aging from the natural but largely benign processes of physiological aging remains unresolved (Bribiescas 2020, Crews 1993, Galkin et al. 2020). Answering this question is key to supporting our burgeoning aging population as effectively and efficiently as possible, a goal that must include efforts aimed at prevention and therapeutic intervention while avoiding overtreatment that detracts from quality of life or personal autonomy for uncertain or very modest improvements in health.

Gut Microbial Intersections with Human Ecology and Evolution,Katherine R. Amato and Rachel N. Carmody,2023,"Over the past two decades, it has become clear that the microbial community in and on the human body functions akin to an organ. This community, known as the microbiota, interacts with multiple body processes and systems, affecting metabolism, immunity, and behavior in myriad ways (Al Nabhani & Eberl 2020, Carmody & Bisanz 2023, Cryan et al. 2019, Pronovost & Hsiao 2019, Visconti et al. 2019). While some components of the microbiota are passed from parents to offspring, and can therefore be considered heritable, environmental factors such as diet, social networks, and hygiene practices also strongly shape the microbiota (Blaser 2016, David et al. 2014, Dominguez Bello et al. 2018, Korpela et al. 2018). As a result, the microbiota is considered a key mediator of host responses to environmental change and is likely a contributor to patterns of human ecology and evolution. However, research on the human microbiota to date has largely been clinical in nature, and important gaps remain in our knowledge that preclude a robust understanding of microbial contributions to human ecology and evolution. For example, it remains unclear which human traits are more strongly influenced by the human genome versus the human microbiota and the extent to which human genomic and microbiome content complement or conflict with each other. Nevertheless, the vast amount of existing microbiome data from humans and nonhuman primates provides an important starting point for understanding these complex relationships.

Here, we outline a broad framework for integrating the human microbiota into current perspectives on human ecology and evolution. Although microbes are found all over the human body, we focus primarily on the gut microbiota, given that it is the richest in both number and taxonomic diversity and is currently the most well-studied human-associated microbial community. We begin by exploring patterns of host-microbiome variation in modern human populations and the factors that drive it. We then describe current understanding of how the human microbiome has changed over evolutionary history and the processes that may have contributed to this change. Next, we leverage data from nonhuman primates to investigate how the gut microbiota can influence host ecology and evolution. Finally, we assess how well host-microbiota relationships identified in nonhuman primates are likely to translate to humans. In addition to summarizing the state of the field, our hope is that this review highlights key unanswered questions, contributes to the generation of new testable hypotheses, and encourages ongoing proliferation of research in this area.",vol52.12
Biocultural Lactation: Integrated Approaches to Studying Lactation Within and Beyond Anthropology,"E.A. Quinn, Aunchalee E.L. Palmquist, and Cecília Tomori",2023,"Anthropology has a rich tradition of critically examining lactation and infant feeding in comparative perspectives across diverse contemporary cultural settings and in historical and evolutionary contexts (Tomori et al. 2018). The process and practices of lactation are particularly suited to anthropological study as lactation is fundamentally a biocultural phenomenon. It is simultaneously grounded in the deep evolutionary history of mammals and also uniquely human. Lactation is foundational for the survival and nurture of exceptionally immature human infants who require close bodily contact, frequent feeding, and care (Rosenberg 2021, Trevathan & Rosenberg 2016). Whether, how, and by whom lactation is practiced throughout human history and in contemporary cultures, however, depend on the broader sociocultural and political economic contexts in which people live because they rely on the intergenerational passage of knowledge of this embodied practice (Tomori et al. 2018, 2022a). This practice builds persons, kin, and community and is entangled in the reproduction of bodies and social orders. Opportunities for diversification and expansion of infant feeding practices have also been profoundly influenced by technological and scientific innovations, but also by environmental degradation and political-ecological upheavals driven by climate change. The diverse approaches of the field have provided unique strengths in conceptualizing and empirically examining biocultural lactation, as anthropology mobilizes a variety of analytical lenses across the natural and social sciences and humanities. Drawing on these perspectives, anthropology has been pivotal in challenging ethnocentric assumptions about infant feeding practices and made important interventions into other fields’ conceptualizations of these issues, including history, sociology, women's and gender studies, science and technology studies, law, medicine, nursing, and global public health. This diversity of perspectives and methodologies, however, also creates unique challenges and has led to considerable fragmentation within anthropology around lactation.",vol52.13
A Linguistic Anthropology of Images,Constantine V. Nakassis,2023,"A linguistic anthropology of images doesn't exist. This statement is true in that images have not served as a central object of concerted theoretical explication for linguistic anthropology for most of its history (as, e.g., language, interaction, and ideology have). The statement, however, is false in at least three ways. First, linguistic anthropologists have long analyzed images of various sorts (photographs, films, etc.), even if they have not always theorized the image as such. Second, some recent research in the field has topicalized the image as object for theorization (as I review in what follows). But most importantly, this statement is falsified once we realize that linguistic anthropology has developed an account of images—sans la lettre and avant l'image, as it were—in its analysis of the pragmatic poetics of discourse. In this review, I work through these three falsifications to spell out and paint a picture of what a linguistic anthropology of images might be, with a particular focus on leveraging the third (the account of the image in discourse, that is, discourse as image) to add to the second (theorizing the image as such).",vol52.14
The Great Pirahã Brouhaha: Linguistic Diversity and Cognitive Universality,Janet Chernela,2023,"Few disputes in academia have been as colorful or bombastic as the brouhaha surrounding the 2005 paper that Daniel Everett published in Current Anthropology, challenging theories of universal grammar and proclaiming the power of culture to constrain and shape cognitive faculties (Everett 2005, pp. 621, 634). Working with the Pirahã, a group of about 300 native people living in the Amazon basin of Brazil, Everett claimed to have found one of the simplest language systems yet documented.

Pirahã, Everett reported, has no numbers or concept of counting; no fixed terms for colors; no perfect tense; no tradition of art or drawing; no creation myths or fiction; no individual or collective memory deeper than two generations; the simplest kinship system known; and, after more than 200 years of regular contact with Brazilian settlers, no ability to communicate in any language other than Pirahã. Everett (2005) attributed this “surprising simplicity” to a cultural principle he called the “immediacy of experience,” in which speakers are limited to referencing only present-time, concrete experience (p. 621).

The most truculent of Everett's claims, however, is his contention that Pirahã syntax displays no evidence of recursive embedding—the capacity of sentences to refer back to themselves indefinitely. The point is consequential because recursion is said by universal grammarians (hereafter, universalists) to be the only design feature of language that is unique to humans and present in all human languages (Hauser et al. 2002, p. 1569). Everett believed that his findings would have the power to undermine that theory. In his 2005 article, he threw down the gauntlet, spurring a debate that would continue for nearly two decades. Linguists from several disciplinary backgrounds entered the fray, including linguistic anthropologists.",vol52.15
The Invisible Labor and Ethics of Interpreting,Laura Kunreuther and Sonya Rao,2023,"In the 2021 American Anthropological Association presidential address, Gupta & Stoolman asked why anthropologists “persist in erasing the labor of those with less cultural and educational capital—translators, teachers in the field, students, and interlocutors in academic settings” (Gupta & Stoolman 2022, p. 786). In this review, we call for heightened recognition of the work of one category implicitly referred to here: interpreters. Interpreters are essential in global and multilingual contexts. Their labor enables global institutions to realize inclusive aspirations. Not coincidentally, then, interpreters are at the center of arenas that anthropologists study: global capitalism, mass media and mediation, Deaf cultures, global health, refugee and migration studies, the humanitarian industry, neoliberalism, multilingualism, and the ethics of fieldwork. Because interpreters work in the nodes of massive economic and political projects, including within anthropologists’ own projects, ethnographic attention to their labor pushes us to think more reflexively about our own professional ethics and the paradoxes of global capitalism within which both interpreters and anthropologists work.

Interpreters engage in embodied communicative labor through the medium of speech or sign language (Koomen 2014, Marie & Friedner 2021, Rao 2021a). Like other forms of communicative labor, it is often devalued, unrecognized, and uncompensated—a form of invisible labor (Crain et al. 2016, Hatton 2017). Interpreters historically tend to be of lower status (women, children, marginalized or coerced workers, servants, slaves), which contributes to this devaluation. In the scholarship about interpreters, invisibility remains a contested frame for discussions about interpreters’ ideal professional roles. Interpreters’ invisible labor overlaps with related forms of labor encompassed within interpreting work that are also often unacknowledged: affective and emotional labor (Hochschild 2012, Mankekar & Gupta 2016) as well as care labor (García-Sánchez 2018). Together, these forms of invisible labor reveal how capital extracts value from “activities it does not recognize as productive [work]” (Lukács 2020, p. 17).

"Social Movements, Power, and Mediated Visibility",Narges Bajoghli,2023,"Smartphones and their inherent visuality have come to consume more of our daily lives since they were introduced as a mass consumer product in the late 2000s. As the underlying technology has become cheaper, their reach has become global (Geismar & Knox 2021). The subsequent popularization of social media and texting platforms has impacted the quotidian rhythms of how we live, interact, and communicate. We are inundated with media on multiple platforms, and their speedy and seemingly ubiquitous circulation impact how we organize ourselves, demand change, rebel, and are, in turn, surveilled, manipulated, and drawn into larger media wars.1 In this article, I discuss current research in anthropology and related fields on the intersections of these topics and point to potential areas for further research for ethnographers in this fast-paced, ever-changing terrain.

This article was initially supposed to be about visual media and social movements. But using prevailing anthropological approaches to studying media, including applying a critical lens to the ways in which visuality is incorporated within larger “media worlds” of production, circulation, and consumption (Ginsburg et al. 2002), it became imperative to bring in the study of hegemonic power to understand more critically the struggles of our times and what social movements are up against in order to become visible in the crowded media environment predominated by social media. At the heart of this article is a discussion not of visual media per se, but rather of how social movements attempt to become visible in today's (screen-saturated) media environment, how those in power seek to make these movements less visible, and what this struggle portends for today's politics.",vol52.17
Language and Race: Settler Colonial Consequences and Epistemic Disruptions,Shalini Shankar,2023,"Linguistic anthropology cannot be decolonized. Or can it? While ways of seeing, hearing, recording, analyzing, writing, publishing, reading, and citing have undoubtedly transformed since Franz Boas (1911) established the anthropological study of language, the field of linguistic anthropology remains bound by the consequences of empire and White supremacy that initially enabled it. Enduring colonial ideologies and institutions, along with Boas's “salvage anthropology,” which separated race and language, have enshrined White racism in anthropological studies of language as well as among linguistic anthropologists.

This article reviews major anthropological paradigms that link the study of language and race. It focuses on the United States as an exemplar of a settler colonial nation that continues to use language as a tool of racialization to bolster White supremacy. Furthering Boas's concept of linguistic relativity, decades of studies analyzed power and inequality with attention to gender, class, and ethnicity, but not race. Ethnographic research on the consequences of settler colonial linguistic racialization was first conducted by Latinx (Zentella 1997) and White women (Hill 1998, Urciuoli 1996). The gender imbalance of this epistemological labor is hardly coincidental; rather, it mirrors the White patriarchal structures of academia, those of colonialism itself.",vol52.18
Making a Difference: The Political Life of Religious Conversion,Michal Kravel-Tovi,2023,"Ostensibly, religious conversion is about making change in one's life. Across the range of disciplinary engagements with the topic of religious conversion (anthropology included), the notion of change has set both the terms and the clusters of questions around which scholarly discussion on the subject has evolved. The nature of change indexed by this concept varies greatly. Conversion is sometimes described in dramatic terms, such as “transformation,” “departure,” “break,” and “ruptures” (Meyer 1998, Thangaraj 2015), and sometimes in more benign terms such as “reorganization” or “passages” (Austin-Broos 2003, Frigerio 2007). It is framed as either a radical turning point—a complete break with the previous self (Beckford 1978); a gradual, partial, and fluid change (Lacar 2001, van Nieuwkerk 2006, Reidhead & Reidhead 2003); an exploratory engagement (e.g., Kraft 2017)—or an ongoing labor and aspiration, a steady quality of religious experience (Coleman 2003). Conversion can be forced, can be an outcome of capitulation, can be sought out voluntarily, or can be situated in a complex structure-agency configuration (Kravel-Tovi 2012, 2019; Smilde 2007; van der Veer 2006). It can be perceived by converts as a nonissue (Meintel 2007), conducted offhandedly, or solemnized by way of formal ritual (Kravel-Tovi 2017, pp. 192–202; Wimberley et al. 1975). The change entailed can be described as a “paradigmatic change” (Jones 1978), “a change in the universe of discourse” (Travisano 1970), a “change of heart” (Heirich 1977), or a “change of identity” (Sachs-Norris 2003), to mention only a few of the terms of choice. These multiple and important varieties notwithstanding, the common point of departure is that conversion occasions a significant change, often with a definite direction and destination.

Ultimately, the interdisciplinary field of conversion studies has been highly engaged with—and, at times, haunted by—the attempt to define itself by assessing the quality, pace, and scope of changes that warrant the rubric of conversion (e.g., Meintel 2007, Rambo 1993, Travisano 1970). When anthropologists entered the field, they questioned the coherence and strength of religious conversion as an analytic category (Asad 1993, p. 47; Chua 2012; Comaroff & Comaroff 1991, pp. 249–58; Roberts 2016). Specifically, scholars have critically observed that the notion of a significant personal change provides a thin and simplified umbrella, imposing the existence of a false conceptual unity on what is, undoubtedly, a highly variable phenomenon within and beyond the Western world. After all, in both indigenous and scholarly discourses, religious conversion denotes an extensive array of changes. It denotes not only the adoption of another religion, but also mass spiritual effervescence, religious awakenings, rebirth, boundary crossings between religious affiliations within the same religion, and trajectories of repentance. Equally important, the concept of religious conversion has been criticized for generating a reified, supposedly universal and stable understanding of religion and religious faith (Comaroff & Comaroff 1991, p. 251), while also masking the Western, modern, and Christian ideological biases of these analytic constructions (Asad 1996, pp. 265–66).",vol52.19
"Critical University Studies
",Vineeta Singh and Neha Vora,2023,"The 2020s have been marked by events of great significance to everyday people as well as national and international institutions, including the global lockdown and financial impacts of COVID-19, the resurgence of Black Lives Matter movements around the world following the murder of George Floyd, an attack on the US Capitol by right-wing extremists and the continuing rise of right-wing populism in many parts of Europe, and US military withdrawal from Afghanistan after more than 20 years, to name just a few. What is the relationship of institutions of higher education to such events and actions? As we were completing this piece, we were following the largest strike of university workers in US history, at all the University of California (UC) campuses, which followed on the heels of a graduate student worker cost-of-living strike in the UC system in 2020. What is the relationship between these strikes and the broader events of the last three years? How do academic labor, study, and knowledge production impact other institutions, such as militaries, states, stock markets, and media, and how are they in turn impacted? In this article, we explore the field that has come to be known as critical university studies (CUS), an interdisciplinary body of scholarship that begins to answer these questions.

Favoring an expansive definition of CUS, we draw from scholars who trace the historical origins of the American university system to the slave trade, racial science, and Native American ethnic cleansing projects (Adams 1995; Stein 2016, 2022; Wilder 2013), as well as scholars who bring abolitionist and decolonial stances to highlight how the university not only is foundationally violent and exclusionary, but continues to perpetuate state interests, carceral and settler logics, empire, and antiblackness in its everyday practices as well as through its knowledge production (Chatterjee & Maira 2014, Ferguson 2012, Grande 2018, Harney & Moten 2013, Trouillot 2003). Many of these approaches come out of anti-imperialist, anticapitalist, and feminist activist movements spearheaded by student activists on college campuses (see, for example, AUIP Editor. Collect. 2010, Ferguson 2017, Libcom 2009).",vol52.20
Remarking the Unmarked: An Anthropology of Masculinity Redux,Matthew Gutmann,2023,"In 1997, when the first review article addressing issues of men and masculinities and men as men appeared in the Annual Review of Anthropology (Gutmann 1997), it was evident that the subject was understudied. In the following years, hundreds of books and articles appeared in what some have called the “ethnographic moment” in men and masculinities studies overall (Connell & Messerschmidt 2005). These studies accomplished in part a filling-in-the-blanks and offered refutations of previous self-satisfied views that as often as not were based on personal experiences and opinions more than on actual research and grounded analysis. And, as always, the best work also helped to refute racist and postcolonial stereotypes, for instance, ethnographies of masculinities in predominantly Muslim countries, which confronted Islamophobia in various guises around the world (see Atshan 2020, Boellstorff 2005, Ewing 2008, Ghannam 2013, Inhorn 2012, Moussawi 2020, Naguib 2015, Peletz 2021).

This profusion of ethnographies has proved valuable in documenting and conceptualizing men and masculinities around the world and through history, thus marking these previously taken-for-granted categories. This new article aims to survey the state-of-the-art studies of men and masculinities in anthropology and ethnography from other disciplines; the emphasis here is on cultural anthropology, but reference is also needed to biological (for example, Bribiescas 2005; Fuentes 2012, 2021), linguistic (for example, Lawson 2020), and archaeological anthropology (for example, Tung 2021, Voss 2008), where important work since 2000 has been done on men, masculinities, violence, sexuality, and similar subjects. Similarly, most citations are to English-language texts, but a small selection of indispensable work in other languages is mentioned. This review addresses the main topical areas in the anthropology of men and masculinities, theoretical frameworks used by and debates among anthropologists and other scholars working on relevant topics, anthropology's main impact in the field more widely, what has changed since the 1990s, and what new challenges this area of study may tackle in the future.",vol52.21
Steps to an Ecology of Algorithms,Willem Schinkel,2023,"Here is a definition of algorithms: Algorithms are standardized ways of satisfying if-then conditionals, often working with Boolean binary values and running on electric circuits, operating autonomously, depending on varying degrees of freedom. Such a definition is of little help to social scientists or to anyone else for that matter. What does it mean to say that algorithms do things? What should anthropology, and social science more broadly, want from, and in, the study of algorithms? And what does it even mean to study algorithms? This review draws together a number of literatures to outline one possible answer to the question of how to study algorithms. That answer is that we should study algorithmic ecologies.

Algorithms have been studied as organizers of attention and addiction (Kockelman 2013, Seaver 2019), as shapers of taste and objects of care and capture (Seaver 2022), and as shapers of publics (Gillespie 2014, Crawford 2016). They have been considered as self-learning drivers of automation (Lowrie 2018) and as powerful fetishes (Thomas et al. 2018). Algorithms have been argued to reorganize modern rationality and vision (Erickson et al. 2013, Halpern 2014, Totaro & Ninno 2014). Studies have focused, among other things, on music improvisation labs (Wilf 2013), music recommender companies (Seaver 2017), precision warfare (Suchman 2020), dating website companies (Illouz 2013), search engines (Gillespie 2014), marketing and web analytic companies (Cheney-Lippold 2011), plagiarism software (Introna 2016), works of art (de Vries & Schinkel 2019), and Netflix (Hallinan & Striphas 2016). Programmatic texts have appeared, pointing the way forward for anthropological studies of algorithms (Dourish 2016; Seaver 2017, 2018), and there is now even an Annual Review of Anthropology article.",vol52.22
"Global Health Interventions: The Military, the Magic Bullet, the Deterministic Model—and Intervention Otherwise","Emily Yates-Doerr, Lauren Carruth, Gideon Lasco, and Rosario García-Meza",2023,"One popular account of global health describes the field as a “collection of problems” that solidified at the start of the twenty-first century, in which a group of people—mostly white men, mostly from the so-called Global North—adopted an approach to health intervention that supplanted the twentieth-century field known as international health (Farmer 2013; see also Brown et al. 2006). In this account, global health comprises a coalition of philanthropic, governmental, nongovernmental, corporate, clinical, and university experts charged with confronting medical pathologies and threats to biosecurity. Packard (2016) writes in his history of the field that “global health” has been constituted as a series of “interventions into the lives of other peoples.”

This history reflects the establishment of global health institutions and the production of global health knowledge and expertise. One study finds that more than 85% of the organizations active in global health or global health policy are headquartered in Europe or North America, and more than 80% of the leaders of global health organizations are nationals of high-income countries, with women holding less than 5% of leadership roles (Davies et al. 2019; Glob. Health 50/50 2020, pp. 17, 26, 30; van Daalen et al. 2020). Racism within global health institutions compounds gender, geographic, and class disparities (Büyüm et al. 2020, Yam et al. 2021). Bhakuni & Abimbola (2021) find that even within the academic field of global health, authorship practices, research partnerships, publishing choices, research questions asked, and methods used, “are peppered with epistemic wrongs that lead to or exacerbate epistemic injustice” (p. e1465). Reflecting on how poorly the United States and United Kingdom handled the outbreak of COVID-19, Dalglish (2020) argues that “the pandemic has given the lie to the notion that [global health] expertise is concentrated in, or at least best channeled by, legacy powers and historically rich states” (p. 1189; see also Manderson et al. 2021).",vol52.23
Security Regimes: Transnational and Imperial Entanglements,"Samar Al-Bulushi, Sahana Ghosh, and Inderpal Grewal",2023,"Security regimes are increasingly an object of interest and a vital subfield of political anthropology. Alongside scholars in geography, international relations, cultural studies, ethnic and race studies, and gender studies, anthropologists have been critically studying the frame of security, approaching it as a logic and relation of power. In a global order dominated by discourses of risk and threat, the ability to shape subjects and govern through public fears has paved the way for expansive and intrusive modes of surveillance, policing, militarized borders, and endless wars.

This article reviews key theoretical and methodological contributions that anthropologists have made to the study of what we call security regimes. While on the one hand the growing preoccupation with security and terrorism has resulted in the expansion of state power (Chalfin 2010, Rana 2011, Masco 2014, Ali 2019, Rizvi 2019), the state is increasingly only one among a range of actors invested in and acting in the name of security (Goldstein 2010, Maguire et al. 2014, Grewal 2017, Diphoorn & Grassiani 2019). We define security regimes as the multilayered ensemble of actors, institutions, discourses, and relations that have manifold effects and exert control over individuals, families, populations, and nations in the name of security. This definition allows us to focus on the study of the state as well as the actors, sites, and relations often considered to be beyond the state. It includes, but is not limited to, the domination of military institutions and technologies over social life.",vol52.24
Decolonizing Museums: Toward a Paradigm Shift,Alaka Wali and Robert Keith Collins,2023,"The 2021 presidential address (Gupta & Stoolman 2022) at the American Anthropological Association annual meeting provoked a months-long debate about anthropology's founders. Gupta asked the assembly to imagine what anthropology might have become as a discipline if it had been decolonizing from its earliest moments, that is, if it had paid attention to the massive dispossessions and violence experienced by colonized peoples across the globe and included analysis of these processes in its explanatory frameworks. Led by Herb Lewis, a chorus of anthropologists mounted a critique of Gupta's lecture on the American Anthropological Association's Communities platform and defended the founders for all the valuable knowledge they had contributed to the peoples with whom they worked. Anthropologists, Lewis and his cohort claimed, were in fact the antithesis of colonial in their mindset and efforts. What struck us as curious about this debate was the absence of any mention of museums either as part of the colonizing project or as valuable holders of cultural knowledge. Despite the fact that scholars of museum practices and curators have created a lively literature on museum decolonization, they appear to remain out of sight for academic anthropology. Nevertheless, discourses and practices addressing decolonization have prevailed among museum staff and scholars, accompanied by significant changes in practices in recent decades. In this review, we consider the trajectory of decolonization efforts in museums, focusing especially on the case of Native North American heritage, with comparison to similar trajectories internationally. The treatment of Native North Americans is important because of the juridical relationship between Native American Nations and the United States government through treaties and legislation. This government-to-government history places a special obligation on museums to remedy colonial harm caused by the disrespect of Native American sovereignty. Another reason for this focus is that Native North Americans are perhaps the most represented and misrepresented people in anthropology and natural history museums.

We begin with a review of decolonizing moments in theory and practice. We reference prior work inspired by the critique of ethnographic museums that took hold in the 1990s, but the intention of the review is to focus on developments after the passage of the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA). We review work in both representations in public displays and also collections care. Throughout, we foreground the important contributions of Native American scholars. The second section of the review discusses the varied forms of collaboration that are surfacing and changing in museum practice, including decentering curatorial authority. The final section of the review foregrounds the fluorescence of tribal museums and how they are contributing to decolonization and indigenization (Krmpotich 2020, Phillips 2011). The processes reviewed here are considered as the emergence of a paradigm shift in both the anthropology of museums and anthropology in museums.",vol52.25
Is a Psychotic Anthropology Possible? Or How to Have Inclusive Anthropologies of Subjectivity and Personhood,John Marlovits and Matthew J. Wolf-Meyer,2023,"Anthropology is predicated on the division between the human and the nonhuman. This division of the human and nonhuman has often depended on the attribution of capacities to humans that nonhuman animals lack, which has informed how the evolutionary record is read as well: For example, modern humans represent a break from early hominids because of capacities for tool use, speech and language, forethought, and creativity. Such claims of human exceptionalism depend on both the attribution of “lack” to nonhumans and the universalization of capacities among human populations (Kafer 2013, Kant 1996, Trouillot 2003). Anthropologists impute that nonhumans do not have these capacities and have later been proven wrong, as more nuanced understandings of nonhuman behavior develop (Cheney & Seyfarth 2008). Similarly, the primacy of sensorial features and forms of cognition that are valued in Western or North Atlantic understandings of the person and subjectivity has been deployed in other contexts, only to be troubled by the importance of other sensorial experiences and ways of conceptualizing the person (Geurts 2003, Howes & Classen 2013, Seremetakis 1994). These combined conceptual moves of imputing lack and universalizing North Atlantic forms of personhood and subjectivity lay the foundation for conceptualizing “normal” human capacities (Davis 1995, Garland Thomson 1996, Grinker 2021), which are implicitly—and sometimes explicitly—associated with imperial whiteness (Anderson 2006, Frankenberg 1997, Hartigan 1999). This universalization of North Atlantic forms of personhood and subjectivity leads to a set of assumptions about what a typical set of human capacities are and generalizes them at the species level in order to make categorical distinctions about what and who counts as human (Wynter 2003). At its most pernicious, this construction of normal humans lays the foundation for an exclusive form of human exceptionalism in which only certain people count as full people, as some people, by dint of physiological impairment or cultural priority, do not exhibit “the” quality that would make them human (Gould 1996, Roberts 2011). From the nineteenth through early twenty-first centuries, these forms of categorical exclusion have reliably created distinctions between normal humans and those who belong in categories associated with difference imputed to race, ethnicity, gender, sex, ability, and age, all of which reify whiteness and able-bodiedness as normalcy (Boisseron 2018, Bordo 1999, Gilman 1988, Luborsky 1994, Martin 1992). This division of the normal and abnormal and their basis in categorical distinctions have especially been the case in relation to cognition, consciousness, and mind, particularly as they are expressed as a function of subjectivity, where some forms of cognition and consciousness are taken as evidence of abnormal minds.

Financialization and the Household,Caitlin Zaloom and Deborah James,2023,"The problems of finance and challenges of sustaining domestic life confront householders with common questions wherever they are encountered: Why and how should they save and spend, borrow and invest? Through the answers, finance and households require and remake each other. The interplay between these domains has not been given the attention that it should receive, however. This is the legacy of a widely accepted—and false—conceptual split between households and finance. The division between the two is not based in observation; it is a political distinction masquerading as a conceptual reflection. Consider student loans in South Africa, the system of credit unions in the United Kingdom, or 401(k) retirement investment plans in the United States. Each financial tool presents itself as a way for individuals to enhance their abilities, a process that seems to retreat from collective life. Following this analysis reproduces an image of financial and economical effectiveness and social power that corporations and government agencies themselves promote. A deeper, more ethnographic examination reveals another story: Family and kin utilize financial instruments such as these to produce relationships and aspirations that bind their lives together and to rework existing expectations.

Understanding finance and its limits, we contend, requires accounting for the household, both as a category and as a set of practices, which we call “householding” (see also Gregory 2009, Fennell 2017). Managing credit, debt, and investment in pursuit of improved lives joins people together as kin; it brings intimate groups into being as they devise a prosperity beyond current resources. This process also ties kin into financial channels, trussing them to banks, states, and money lenders, among other institutions. Householding and finance rely on each other, but the significance is greater still: The possibilities and dangers of finance compel householders to create novel social forms and arrangements.",vol52.27
White Supremacy and the Making of Anthropology,"Aisha M. Beliso-De Jesús, Jemima Pierre, and Junaid Rana",2023,"The concept of white supremacy has historically been associated with well-known examples of racism and violence such as Jim Crow segregation in the United States, the apartheid system in South Africa, and Aryan theories and violence perpetrated by Hitler's Nazi party. More recently, white supremacy has been linked with white racist hate groups, where violence propagated by white nationalists, neo-Nazis, and the “alt-right” are described by popular media and academics as one of the primary “threats” to liberal democracy (Bergmann et al. 2018). In this review, we challenge this characterization by presenting a historical and contemporary view of white supremacy as an entrenched global system forged through the promulgation of the idea of white racial superiority as part of the enactment and justification of transatlantic slavery and European conquest and colonization of the world. Furthermore, after World War I, white supremacy was enshrined in the “international world order” through the consolidation of European (and, later, US) imperial power (Grovogui 1996, 2001).

White supremacy, we argue, extends beyond the recognized understandings of race, racialization, and racism (see the sidebar titled On the Capitalization of Racial Categories). It depends on the idea of “race as a hierarchical relationship of power based on presumed biological and cultural difference as well as related practices of racism, the valorization of whiteness, and the denigration of nonwhiteness” (Pierre & Beliso-De Jesús 2021, p. 250). Since race depends on racialization processes, and racial meanings are in flux (even as whiteness maintains its power position), articulations of white supremacy also shift depending on cultural and political contexts. Despite its origins in specific conditions, white supremacy is an interlocking political, cultural, social, and economic system that has evolved over time and takes on different forms around the world. As Caribbean historian Walter Rodney notes, “[E]verywhere in the world white people held power in all its aspects—political, economic, military, and even cultural” (Rodney 1969, p. 17). To analyze white supremacy, then, is to examine how it is structured in global economic and political processes, in and through our institutions, in our everyday social relations, and in the theories and methods of Western academic disciplines such as anthropology.",vol52.28
"Publics, Polls, Protest: Public Representation as Sociopolitical Practice",Amahl A. Bishara,2023,"Across a variety of locations, the last decade has seen vertiginous changes in our assumptions about both formal political processes and publics. Those holding faith in democratic processes have too often been left queasy as actors deploy media to undermine elections. Indeed, many see an instability to arise from the inextricable links between media and political processes. This review seeks to illuminate some connections across studies of publics, formal political processes, and protests. An examination of representation as sociopolitical practice allows scholars to consider the practices that occur around the edges of what has been considered the public sphere and to interrogate the ideological work of those boundaries, which reify national publics, separate civil society from formal politics, and distinguish representational work from collective action. Viewing media, formal political processes, and protests as interrelated phenomena invites the study of people whose involvement spans more than one of these practices and sheds light on the unexpected consequences of these phenomena. Finally, a focus on representational practices trains attention on the body, place, and social relations and asks anthropologists to attend to the multiplicity of ways in which violence shapes and can be produced by environments for expression.

While in some liberal formulations, representation is reduced to mere reflection, anthropologists have long recognized that representation is productive and that it is inseparable from other social processes. Scholars have shown the relationships between the concept of political representation (by proxy) and representation as depiction (as portrait) across various settings (Bardawil 2020, p. 19, citing Spivak 1995; see also Latour 2005). The “public” likewise has two distinct meanings: (a) discursive spaces produced by practice and (b) physical spaces accessible to many; these two meanings have often been artificially held apart but deserve integrated investigation (Manning 2022). The public is also “a potent ideological figure of the democratic imagination” (Strassler 2020, p. 16). This article considers how these senses of representation and the public ricochet off one another. Examining the “media worlds” produced by media practices (Ginsburg et al. 2002) and looking at politics and publics (Cody 2011) in tandem—similar to what Vidali & Tufte write about as “civic mediations” that capture the “emergent and dynamic nature of public/civic life” (Vidali & Tufte 2014, p. 8)—is a field-defining quality of the anthropology of sociopolitical practice today. Elsewhere, these questions have too often been pursued as though the United States and Europe are the norms. Anthropology offers a distinctly global perspective, and the discipline has adopted lessons from critical Indigenous studies that challenge colonial and liberal assumptions about expression, politics, and sovereignty. Furthermore, disability studies and queer studies provide approaches to foreground issues of place, embodiment, affect, and power.",vol52.29
